This release has been a while in the making and covers substantial changes since the last release. We are grateful for the support of the Sovereign Tech Fund towards this goal. These are some of the changes:
The implementation caught up with the latest changes in the protocol specification. The last version was roughly based on draft 12. Since then, the protocol has iteratively evolved all the way through draft 20.</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS v0.4 Release</title><link>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2022-02-28-v0_4-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2022-02-28-v0_4-release/</guid><description>Today, we are excited to announce the release of v0.4 of OpenMLS! ðŸŽ‰
Some time has passed since we wrote about our roadmap to v0.4. In this post, we want to provide some insight into what has happened in the development of OpenMLS generally, but also relative to the goals we included in the roadmap.
Our high-level goal with v0.4 was to reach a state where we have an API stable enough and an implementation robust enough such that people interested in OpenMLS can start exploring it in the context of their own projects.</description></item></channel></rss>

In #1546 we merged support for the X-Wing KEM draft, which is an early draft for securely combining elliptic-curve-based Diffie-Hellman with ML-KEM. In particular, OpenMLS now supports the ciphersuite MLS_256_XWING_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519 with ciphersuite 0x004D. There is no IANA code-point for this ciphersuite yet, such that interoperability may not be guaranteed. We work with other implementers towards interoperability of this ciphersuite.
The implementation uses Cryspenâ€™s formally verified ML-KEM and x25519 implementations from libcrux.</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://phnx.im/">Phoenix R&amp;amp;D&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.cryspen.com">Cryspen&lt;/a> join forces to bring OpenMLS closer to v1.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html">MLS protocol&lt;/a> draft is in the IETF working group&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/bOhxmpo70T-ikDd40OqQfst64gE/">last call&lt;/a> and is thus
on track to become an RFC soon.
We want to make sure that OpenMLS is ready for wider adoption by the time the
RFC is ready.
To achieve this we start by catching up with all the changes to the protocol
(up to the current draft-16), improving test coverage of the code, and working
towards a more comprehensive test framework for interoperability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenMLS v0.4 Roadmap</title><link>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another update on OpenMLS because many things are happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we are excited to announce a public roadmap for OpenMLS v0.4. This will not even be close to a v1.0 release because the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">spec&lt;/a> is still not finished and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how the library will be used. Nonetheless will v0.4 be a significant release with a mostly stable API and most functionality being implemented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the next five months we will fix the most pressing issues and make OpenMLS a usable MLS library for consumers to use. We are well aware that there is almost no experience with using MLS in a messaging product. (Cisco&amp;rsquo;s Webex is rolling out MLS for &lt;a href="https://www.btconferencing.com/downloads-library/services/webex-versions/t41/Webex_Latest_Channel_Customer_Monthly_Update_41.7.pdf">end-to-end encrypted video calls&lt;/a> as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/collaboration/white-paper-c11-744553.html">zero-trust initiative&lt;/a> right now.) The goal is therefore to offer a mostly stable API and complete feature set for consumers to start using it. However, we expect a significant feedback cycle to improve the APIs to make OpenMLS better suited for applications.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

Phoenix R&amp;amp;D and Cryspen join forces to bring OpenMLS closer to v1.0.
The MLS protocol draft is in the IETF working group&amp;rsquo;s last call and is thus on track to become an RFC soon. We want to make sure that OpenMLS is ready for wider adoption by the time the RFC is ready. To achieve this we start by catching up with all the changes to the protocol (up to the current draft-16), improving test coverage of the code, and working towards a more comprehensive test framework for interoperability.</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS v0.4 Roadmap</title><link>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another update on OpenMLS because many things are happening behind the scenes.
Today we are excited to announce a public roadmap for OpenMLS v0.4. This will not even be close to a v1.0 release because the spec is still not finished and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how the library will be used. Nonetheless will v0.4 be a significant release with a mostly stable API and most functionality being implemented.</description></item></channel></rss>

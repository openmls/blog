Failing to do so can lead to inadvertant leakage of private information, state corruption, impersonation attacks&amp;hellip; all kinds of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example, you might remember &lt;a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html"&gt;the &amp;ldquo;goto fail&amp;rdquo; vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, a bug in the TLS implementation used in iOS. Here, the verification function of signatures sent along with the &lt;code&gt;ServerKeyExchange&lt;/code&gt; message, which ties the server identity to the transcript and ephemeral key material. Due to a hard-to-spot slipup, it returned success early and never really checked the signature, which would allow an attacker to man-in-the-middle the connection. While in this case they didn&amp;rsquo;t just &lt;em&gt;forget&lt;/em&gt; to do the check, it does demonstrate why these checks are important.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS 0.6 released</title><link>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2024-09-04-v0_6-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2024-09-04-v0_6-release/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing version 0.6 of OpenMLS. In this post we’ll go over the most significant changes since our last release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="new-storage-provider"&gt;New Storage Provider&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier to persist group state, the &lt;code&gt;KeyStoreProvider&lt;/code&gt; was replaced with the more powerful &lt;code&gt;StorageProvider&lt;/code&gt; trait for tracking the state of a group or a party. This includes keys, but also other group state like the ratchet tree and the group context. OpenMLS writes to the storage at the end of any successful operation. This means that if the provider is backed by some persistent memory, the entire long-lived state of OpenMLS is automatically persisted.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS 0.5 released</title><link>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2023-07-20-v0_5-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.openmls.tech/posts/2023-07-20-v0_5-release/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing OpenMLS v0.5. This release has been a while in the making and covers substantial changes since the last release. We are grateful for &lt;a href="https://openmls.tech/blog/2022-10-19-update/"&gt;the support of the Sovereign Tech Fund&lt;/a&gt; towards this goal. These are some of the changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation caught up with the latest changes in the protocol specification. The last version was roughly based on draft 12. Since then, the protocol has iteratively evolved all the way through draft 20. The library now implements the wire format of messages and mechanisms specified in &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420"&gt;RFC 9420&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive &lt;a href="https://github.com/mlswg/mls-implementations"&gt;interoperability testing&lt;/a&gt; has been done between OpenMLS, Cisco’s MLS++, and another closed-source MLS protocol implementation. The goal of this exercise was to validate the last set of changes in the specification and ascertain that all implementations implemented the specification correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-next-phase"&gt;The next phase&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the specification was a moving target and so was the implementation. Now that the specification is no longer subject to changes, the implementation can finally mature in terms of correctness, ease-of-use, and efficiency.
We would like OpenMLS to be as useful as possible to those who consider end-to-end encryption with MLS. We are ready to evolve the library in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

Phoenix R&amp;amp;D and Cryspen join forces to bring OpenMLS closer to v1.0.
The MLS protocol draft is in the IETF working group&amp;rsquo;s last call and is thus on track to become an RFC soon. We want to make sure that OpenMLS is ready for wider adoption by the time the RFC is ready. To achieve this we start by catching up with all the changes to the protocol (up to the current draft-16), improving test coverage of the code, and working towards a more comprehensive test framework for interoperability.</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS v0.4 Release</title><link>https://openmls.tech/blog/2022-02-28-v0_4-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openmls.tech/blog/2022-02-28-v0_4-release/</guid><description>Today, we are excited to announce the release of v0.4 of OpenMLS! 🎉
Some time has passed since we wrote about our roadmap to v0.4. In this post, we want to provide some insight into what has happened in the development of OpenMLS generally, but also relative to the goals we included in the roadmap.
Our high-level goal with v0.4 was to reach a state where we have an API stable enough and an implementation robust enough such that people interested in OpenMLS can start exploring it in the context of their own projects.</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS v0.4 Roadmap</title><link>https://openmls.tech/blog/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openmls.tech/blog/2021-10-19-openmls-04-roadmap/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another update on OpenMLS because many things are happening behind the scenes.
Today we are excited to announce a public roadmap for OpenMLS v0.4. This will not even be close to a v1.0 release because the spec is still not finished and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how the library will be used. Nonetheless will v0.4 be a significant release with a mostly stable API and most functionality being implemented.</description></item><item><title>OpenMLS Performance</title><link>https://openmls.tech/blog/openmls-first-benchmarks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://openmls.tech/blog/openmls-first-benchmarks/</guid><description>In this blog post, I explore how MLS&amp;rsquo; aspiration to be scalable manifests itself in OpenMLS.
The charter in particular claims the following:
Resource requirements have good scaling in the size of the group (preferably sub-linear)
While performance can be theoretically analysed for MLS it is also interesting to see whether the performance goals hold up in a real implementation. This of course only looks at a single implementation. Nonetheless, I think that it gives a good impression on the actual performance of MLS implementations.</description></item></channel></rss>

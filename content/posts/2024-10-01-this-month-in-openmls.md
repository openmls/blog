_OpenMLS Development Update - September 2024_

Welcome to the inaugural post in our new series, designed to keep you informed
about the latest developments on OpenMLS.

Each month, we'll highlight significant changes, share key milestones, and
provide insights into our ongoing work.

At the beginning of September we released [OpenMLS v0.6](./2024-09-04-v0_6-release.md) | [ðŸ“¦](https://crates.io/crates/openmls/0.6.0).

The month has been pretty quiet after the release while we started to complete
the [semantic validation checks in OpenMLS](https://validation.openmls.tech)
to ensure that OpenMLS is always safe to use.
Read more about it in [Jan's blog post](../2024-09-30-taking-stock-of-validation-checks).

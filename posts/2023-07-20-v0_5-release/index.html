We are ready to evolve the library in the following areas:\nStabilize the persistence format Improve and harmonize the API Improve efficiency Support new platforms Add optional features and extensions Looking for help? If you are looking to use OpenMLS in your project the OpenMLS team can offer professional help with consulting or with implementing.
